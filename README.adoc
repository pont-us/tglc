= tglc: manipulate 2G data files

tglc is a Python library to manipulate 2G magnetometer data files.

It can do things like rewriting sample depths, inverting remanence
measurements, and assembling multiple core sections into a single file with
consistent depth data.

The code is documented where necessary but should be mostly self-explanatory.

tglc is compatible with Python versions 3.7 and up, and with version 2.7.
